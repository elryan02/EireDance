***** DESCRIPTION *****
This is my final project for Code Louisville's FSJS course. My application is a database of exercises targeted at Irish dancers. Irish dance is a very niche sport, and there are not many resources geared toward the unique requirements of the sport. EireDance allows you to access three workouts targeting the main apects of Irish Dance (Footwork, Mobility, and Posture) and allows users to add to these in order to suit their own personal needs. A future version of this will include logins and user specific workouts.
